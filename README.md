# TESTING THEORY

This section contains the theoretical foundation of software testing, demonstrated through the example of an online store project.  
It includes the classification of testing methods, levels, and types, as well as a detailed analysis of system requirements for the store’s key modules.

[Analysis of online store requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HSI-hDOz0tnDD43_Gk5A0FC1ABkzy-INULRnRf8xQQg/edit?usp=sharing) - requirement review and defect analysis for modules such as Registration, Authorization, Product Catalog, Cart, and Order Management.

## What this repo demonstrates

This repository demonstrates my understanding of **software testing theory** and how it applies to real projects.  
It includes practical summaries and structured examples covering:

- **Testing types and levels** — explanation of unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.  
- **Testing methods** — black-box, white-box, and grey-box testing with justifications for each.  
- **Requirement analysis** — detailed review of e-commerce system requirements and identification of ambiguities.  
- **Testing approaches** — from smoke and regression to performance and security testing.  

These materials were created as part of studying QA fundamentals and are applied in my practical test documentation across other repositories.
